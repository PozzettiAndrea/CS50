This site, running on flask, makes use of a keras machine learning algorithm to distinguish between pictures of cats and dogs.
Users can register, log in, and see a history of their submissions, complete with a small thumbnail.
The site's layout was created using bootstrap, and the keras algorithm was trained on Spyder.
